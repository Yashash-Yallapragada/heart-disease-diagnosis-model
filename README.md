# Heart Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using patient clinical data and multiple machine learning models. Early and accurate prediction can help healthcare professionals in timely diagnosis and treatment planning.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)  
- **Number of samples**: 918  
- **Number of features**: 11  
- **Target variable**: HeartDisease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values â€” none found  
- Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding  
- Feature scaling applied using StandardScaler  
- Train-test split: 80% training, 20% testing

## Models and Performance

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

| Model               | Accuracy  | Precision (0) | Recall (0) | Precision (1) | Recall (1) | F1-Score (Weighted) |
|---------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 84.23%    | 0.77           | 0.88        | 0.91           | 0.81        | 0.84                 |
| SVM                 | 86.41%    | 0.82           | 0.86        | 0.89           | 0.87        | 0.86                 |
| Random Forest       | 89.67%    | 0.86           | 0.90        | 0.92           | 0.90        | 0.90                 |
| LightGBM            | 88.04%    | 0.85           | 0.87        | 0.90           | 0.89        | 0.88                 |

> *All models were fine-tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.*
